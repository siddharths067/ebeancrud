# ebeancrud
A simple CRUD Implementation for Java Ebean ORM on Play.

# YOU ARE NOT ALONE

Even I was having trouble learning how to use Ebean ORM with the Play Framework, the documentation on the subject matter is shit AF.
Everything everywhere is outdated, for beginners like me I will upload a simple tutorial on how to set yourself up.
Mail me if this is urgent to you at siddharths067@gmail.com

Meanwhile I used these pages to look around for changes in the latest sbt Play and the old activator powered one
